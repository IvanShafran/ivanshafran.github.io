### 2025-10-08 VK Calls in the Forest: Calling in Bad Networks

VK Calls can work even with high packet loss and low network bandwidth. While the internet in big cities is fast and stable, riding the subway, using an elevator, or connecting to Wi-Fi in a café can still cause call quality issues. We'll explain how we tackled this on the Android client and what audio and connection techniques you can use in your project for calls.

### 2024-10-7 Micro Open Source: From Passion to Pet Project Publication

In this talk, we will explore the journey of publishing your pet project, library, or application to the open-source community. We will cover key topics, including choosing a good idea, publishing your project, gaining users, engaging with the community, and more. Even small projects can make a significant impact, so join us to learn how to share your work with the world and potentially change it.

### 2024-06-17 Mastering WebRTC for Large Conference Calls on Android

WebRTC is a common tool for making internet calls. It's easy to set up calls between two people, but things get tricky with group video calls, especially when you want to have lots of people join. In this talk, we'll break down how video, audio, and the structure of WebRTC work. Using VK calls as an example, we'll discuss how to make these components work well for thousands of people, focusing on what Android developers need to know.

### 2024-05-23 VK Calls: Boosting WebRTC Calls Quality

The VK Calls team has been dedicated to advancing video communication based on the WebRTC framework for over five years. While this technology is widely used for quick implementation of one-on-one calls, there are several areas that can be improved. Moreover, with each passing year, users demand increasingly higher standards for service quality.

The talk will cover enhancements for audio, video, screen sharing, and device connectivity. For instance, optimizations for screen capture will be discussed for various types of content. These developments are categorized by complexity level for application, allowing participants of the conference with varying levels of experience in video communication to grasp useful insights.

In conclusion, we will dig into how we measure the changes we implement to ensure they are beneficial.

### 2021-12-01 VK Calls: connecting thousands of people with Android and iOS using WebRTC

In this talk, guys will describe the usage of WebRTC for the group calls creation on Android and iOS clients:

– first, we will connect two participants and improve the quality of audio and video communication to the level of market leaders and better;

– we will find out why the standard screen sharing in WebRTC works poorly and how to fix it;

– we will discuss UI optimizations, noise reduction, virtual backgrounds, a beauty filter;

– further, we will determine the bottlenecks of the client SDK and develop a solution for a thousand people in one call using the example of VK Calls.

Of course, we will discuss Android and iOS specific call APIs, and the speaker will share their experience.

### 2021-11-23 VK Calls: connecting thousands of people with Android and iOS using WebRTC

WebRTC is an industry standard for creating service of Internet calls. With its help VOIP connection is implemented just in a couple of lines, when two people take part in a call. But it's not that simple with group video calls, especially when you want to make calls without any restrictions for the number of participants. Here WebRTC turns out to be a source of issues and disappointment.

In this talk we will learn video, audio and architecture of WebRTC. Using VK calls as an example, the speakers will talk about optimizations of these components for thousands of participants from the point of view of Android and iOS clients.
